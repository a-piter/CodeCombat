# CodeCombat
Code for levels I have beat in the online CodeCombat game. 
CodeCombat is an online game that teaches code, while your hero slays ogers and other dangerous enemies.
For each item your hero equipes, your hero is granted skills that allow you to write different code to accomplish your mission. 
For example, your standard boots allows you to write moveXY functions, while boots of jumping allows you to use jumpTo.

Notes written by the game developers are denoated with #. 
Notes written by me are denoated with """ """. 
My notes are usually reminders about what items to equip, for my code to work.
