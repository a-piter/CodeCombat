# CodeCombat
Code for levels I have beat in the online CodeCombat game. 
CodeCombat is an online game that teaches code, while your hero slays ogers and other dangerous enemies.
Each item your hero is granted skills for you to use different code to accomplish your mission. 
For example, your standard boots allows you to use moveXY, while boots of jumping allows you to use jumpTo.
Notes written by the game developers are denoated with #. 
Notes written by me are denoated with """ """
